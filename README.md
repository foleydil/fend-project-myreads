# MyReads Project

This is a project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, as part of the Front End Web Developer nanodegree program. This is a React-based app, which allows a user to categorize books as "read," "currently reading," or "want to read," and will save their choices on a back-end server. These choices are displayed on the home page (the "Book List") on the relevant shelf. The user can also search for books to add to their shelves, and each book has a dropdown to allow the user to change a book's shelf designation.

## Running the App

* clone the repository to your local machine, and cd into the directory
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* in your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work.

An internet connection is _required_ for the backend server to fetch results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is a project for my own contribution as part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree program. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
